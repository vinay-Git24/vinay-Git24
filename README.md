### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Vinay!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on refining Java and Unix shell scripts that meet strict platform constraints like Lumenâ€™s formatting and test case validation.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m deepening my knowledge of Linux internals,Ansible Server configuration and advanced scripting logicâ€”always up for a quiz challenge or debugging marathon.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on automation tools, CLI utilities, and platform-adaptive scripts with clean, readable logic.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m open to insights on optimizing real-world batch scripts, enhancing portability, and cutting redundant loops from matrix math to cron tasks.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about scripting edge cases, plagiarism-free academic rewriting, or the quirks of formatting output on strict grading engines.
