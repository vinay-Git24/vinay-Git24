### Hi there 👋 I’m Vinay!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on refining Java and Unix shell scripts that meet strict platform constraints like Lumen’s formatting and test case validation.
- 🌱 I’m deepening my knowledge of Linux internals and advanced scripting logic—always up for a quiz challenge or debugging marathon.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on automation tools, CLI utilities, and platform-adaptive scripts with clean, readable logic.
- 🤔 I’m open to insights on optimizing real-world batch scripts, enhancing portability, and cutting redundant loops from matrix math to cron tasks.
- 💬 Ask me about scripting edge cases, plagiarism-free academic rewriting, or the quirks of formatting output on strict grading engines.
- 📫 How to reach me: [sonivinay123456789@gmail.com, www.linkedin.com/in/vinay-k-soni-044540209, or https://github.com/vinay-Git24]
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: My Fibonacci program has been debugged more times than I’ve brewed coffee—and that’s saying something!
